improve fitness calculation
    absolute or relative fitness
    efficiency

improve dna crossover
    first half from one second half from the other
    each gene has a 50/50 chance to come from either parent

implement random mutations
    every single thing has a chance to change slightly
    or should each rocket have a chance to mutate and if so:
        pick a random start pos in DNA
        from that point to the end change each one slightly

Add obstacle
Possibly change walls so out one side and back in the other


BUGS!!!!!!
sometimes the returned list of positions is too short, maybe from hitting target or walls?
